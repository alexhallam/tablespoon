# Skill Score

One of the primary purposes of this package is to generate forecast methods as benchmarks.

One way to use these methods as benchmarks is to generate *skill scores*.

Skill scores have the general form:

$$
\frac{\text{CRPS}_{\text{Naïve}} - \text{CRPS}_{\text{Alternative}}}{\text{CRPS}_{\text{Naïve}}}.
$$

In the equation above we used `CRPS`, but any metric may be used.
