# Introduction

Many methods exist for probabilistic forecasting. If you are looking for
impressive probabilistic forecasting package see the list of recommendation at
the bottom of this README. This package is <b>exceptionally ordinary</b>. It is
expected that this package may be used as a compliment to what is already out
there.

# Quick Example

We show a quick example below. For more examples see [EXAMPLES.md](docs/EXAMPLES.md)

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import tablespoon as tbsp
from cmdstanpy import install_cmdstan


# If this is your first time installing cmdstanpy
install_cmdstan()

# pull and clean data
# columns must have the columns "ds" and "y"
df = (
    pd.read_csv("https://storage.googleapis.com/data_xvzf/m5_state_sales.csv")
    .query("state_id == 'CA'")
    .rename(columns={"date": "ds", "sales": "y"})
    .assign(y=lambda df: np.log(df.y))
)

# Snaive model
sn = tbsp.Snaive()
df_sn = sn.predict(df, horizon=10, uncertainty_samples = 8000)
print(df_sn.head())

# Complete Data is Required: Models Error when time series is missing dates 
n = tbsp.Naive()
df_missing = df.drop([3])
df_n = n.predict(df_missing, horizon=10, uncertainty_samples = 8000)

```

# Why Run Simple Methods

We have found, by experience, many good uses for the methods in this package.
To often we see that forecast method go in production without a naive method to
accompany it. In our eyes we see that this is a missed opportunity. 

1. **Naive May Be Good Enough**: Some applications do not need anything more
   impressive than a simple forecasting method.
2. **Get A Denominator for Relative Metrics**: Though naive methods can usually
   be beat it is good to know the relative improvement over the benchmark. This
   can allow a forecasting team to market their alternative forecast when the
   'skill score' is impressive.
3. **Easy to productionize and get expectations**: Get a sense for how good is
   good enough. In many applications a forecast team is asked to forecast, but
   stakeholders provide no line-in-the-sand for when the forecasting work needs
   to stop. One reasonable approach is to run the benchmarks found in this
   package in beat the best performing benchmark by a margin that is
   statistically significant.
4. **Resilience in Production - Why not have many models?**: Sometimes, despite
   out best efforts our production model does something unexpected. In this
   case it is nice to have a simple backup that is cheap to generate and good
   enough to fall back on. In this way a production forecast pipeline gains
   strength from a diversity of models.
5. **Easy Uncertainty Quantification**: More and more we see that application
   are not about forecast accuracy, but instead about forecasting uncertainty.
   Capturing the full distribution helps firms set "service levels" aka
   percentiles of the distribution for which they are prepared to serve. Even
   if you have the worlds most accurate unbiased forecast the median point is
   an underforecast half the time. For this reason it is best to provide a
   distribution of simulated future values and the firm may decide for
   themselves what risks they are or are not willing to take.

# Goals of this package

1. ‚ôô**Simple**: Not just in the forecasts themselves, but also from the
   users perspective.
2. ‚ôù**Documented**: It should be very clear exactly how forecasts are getting
   generated. We document the parameterization of the models to make this as
   obvious and uninteresting as possible. See [Forecast Method Documentation](docs/FORECAST_METHODS.md)
3. ‚ôû**Accessible**: Because of how important we feel simple forecasting
   methods are we want as many front end binding as possible to expose these
   methods to the largest audience possible. We eventually have binding in
   `Shell`,`Julia`,`R`, and `Python`.
3. ‚ôú**Stable**: We want this package to feel rock solid. For this to happen
   we keep the feature set relatively small. We believe that after the initial 
   development of this package we should spend out time maintaining the code as
   oppose to thinking of new features.
4. ‚ôõ**Distributional**: Quantification of uncertainty is the name of
   the game.


# Non-Goals

1. üî•**Circut Melting Focus on Speed**: Not to say this is a slow package. In fact, all
   models do get compiled. It is very fast. We just don't put any extra effort to make 
   it faster than the base Stan compiled model.
2. ü§ñ**New Forecast Models**: Again, this is out of scope. If you are
   looking for recommendations please see the bottom of the page.

# Recommended probabilistic forecasting packages

There are many packages that can compliment `tablespoon`

[forecast](https://github.com/robjhyndman/forecast): The king of forecasting
packages. Rob Hyndman is a professor of forecasting and has served as editor of
the journal "International Journal of Forecasting". If you are new to
forecasting please read his free ebook [fpp3](https://otexts.com/fpp3/).

[prophet](https://facebook.github.io/prophet/): A very capable and reliable
forecasting package. I have never seen a bad forecast come out of prophet.

[gluonts](https://ts.gluon.ai/). If you are itching to use neural nets for
forecasting this is a good one to pick.

# Learn more about forecasting

   and read their publications.

# Beta

This package is currently being tested. It is very much unfinished at this point.
Feel free to use what is currently available.
